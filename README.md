# rootzcoin

my personal blockchain for using rootzcoin, because it seems everyone has one these days

based on [Fireship's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF7dkrce-mQ&list=WL&index=10&ab_channel=Fireship) and [repo](https://github.com/fireship-io/node-blockchain)

### usage
```
git clone https://github.com/ruthrootz/rootz-coin
npm install
npm start
```
